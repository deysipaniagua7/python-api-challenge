# python-api-challenge

This is the repository that holds my Module 6 Python-Api-Challenge.

-“WeatherPy” contains my code for the first part of the assignment
-“VacationPy” contains my code for the second part of the assignment
-“output_data” contains my “cities” ouput and saved scatterplots

Module Overview: In this challenge, we were asked to use OpenWeather to retrieve weather data from multiple cities and create several scatterplot to show the relationship between latitude vs: temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and windspeed. We were also asked to compute the linear regresison for each relationship and separate these plots into Northern and Southern hemispheres. For each of the pairs, we had to describe the relationship. 

In part 2, we used Geoapify to create map visualizations to show: multiple cities and their humidity, a narrowed list of these cities with an ideal weather condition, and hotels within 10,000 meters of our coordinates.

Please note, I used in-class activities/notes and the following resources to complete my assignments:
